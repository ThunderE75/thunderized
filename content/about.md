# Hello World!

Welcome to my personal corner of the web!

This site is still a work in progress, but it’s meant to be more than just a placeholder. I plan to share blogs, project write-ups, and thoughts on technology, learning, and the occasional deep dive into experiments I find exciting.

I’m Navneet, currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications at Amity University, where I’m specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My academic path is complemented by a lot of hands-on tinkering, coding, and exploring - much of which lives on my GitHub.

Beyond projects, I enjoy experimenting with Linux, scripting in Bash, working with cloud tools, and diving into new frameworks. My interests span software engineering, data-driven problem solving, and building tools that people can actually use.

This site will slowly evolve as I share what I learn, build, and break along the way. Stay tuned for more updates, and if you’re curious about what I’m up to, check out my GitHub, it’s the most honest reflection of what I find interesting at the moment.
